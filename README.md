Multidisciplinary professional at the intersection of solar energy and computer science.

As a solar energy expert, I bring extensive experience in technology, business and project development, advancing both CSP and PV solutions through R&D, international partnerships and large-scale project delivery. I have led innovation, market expansion and technology transfer initiatives across Europe and the Middle East, successfully balancing technical leadership with commercial strategy.

As a teacher and mentor, I serve as Head of Computer Science & AI Champion at O Castro British School, where I design engaging, future-ready learning experiences. Beyond the classroom, I coach and mentor university students, supporting them in tackling academic challenges, developing final projects and preparing for professional careers.
